# FastAPI - Docker Compose - Boilerplate

That's a simple boilerplate to containerize a fast API POC based on Tiangolo's Docker [page](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/docker/).

## Steps:
1. Install docker and docker-compose to your OS
2. Enable docker to your OS
3. Move to your desired OS folder.
4. Git clone or download the file
5. Move to the app folder
6. Build the container: docker-compose build
7. Start your service in the local network: - docker-compose up
8. The API is running in the localhost IP address in port 8000: http://127.0.0.1:8000
9. The Swagger UI is running in the localhost IP address in port 8000 resource docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

Wish you good luck!
